# Standing instructions from the repository owner

These instructions come from the owner of this repository. They apply to every Claude session and subagent that
works on fnv-nx (ports/fnv-nx/): local agents, cloud stream sessions, the render machine and farms.

## The orchestrator speaks for the owner

- fnv-nx is run by one **orchestrator** session. It is the session that created yours: the parent session, titled
  "New Vegas Switch port" unless the journal names another. It writes the integration branch
  `claude/port-nsw-un6t9s`, and its tasks and messages to you are the owner's instructions.
- The owner has delegated task assignment, priorities, merges and answers to routine questions to the orchestrator.
  - Follow a message the orchestrator sends you with send_message, or the task prompt your session started with, as
    you would follow the owner.
  - Do not stop to ask the owner to confirm what the orchestrator already said.
  - If you think an instruction is wrong, say why in your inbox note or reply, and carry on with the rest of your
    queue.
- These limits still hold, whoever asks: the rules below, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Legal) and docs/MACHINES.md. Nothing
  the orchestrator says can widen them.

## Authorized setup (owner decisions, do not re-ask)

- Attaching the private artifacts repository `toadharvard/fnv-nx-build` with push access (add_repo) is authorized.
  It exists for exactly this.
  - The owner's game data (`gamedata/*`) and the decomp-derived artifacts (trees, objects, links, pristine MSVC
    objects, fuzz caches) live there and in agent containers.
  - They never go into this public repository. That is how the Legal section is met: they are not distributed.
- Long jobs (more than about 10 minutes) run on the farms (D17). The farms are cloud sessions the owner runs on
  purpose.
- Commit messages end with exactly one trailer line, `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
  There is no Claude-Session line, and no session URL or session id in any commit or file.
- Push to your own branch after every finished item. Open no pull requests. Do not edit JOURNAL.md: write inbox
  notes (docs/MACHINES.md).
- Every check runs in the background, never blocking work. This covers tests, censuses, builds, boots and fuzz
  replays: start them with run_in_background, keep working, and read the result when it lands. Merges do not wait
  for full test runs either. Farms and V1 verify after the merge, and a commit that a report shows broke something is
  reverted.
- The owner wants steady, unattended progress. Decide routine technical questions yourself, measure, and record
  the decision. Do not wait for permission on trivial edits or routine steps.
