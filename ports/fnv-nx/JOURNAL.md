# fnv-nx development journal

Append-only. Never edit or delete an entry: to correct one, append a new entry with `supersedes: J-xxxx`.
`tools/journal.sh status` prints the latest state of every stream and every open fork; `tools/journal.sh next`
prints the next free entry id.

## Format

Each entry starts with one header line (grep-able, one field per `|`):

    ### J-NNNN | YYYY-MM-DD | stream: S<n>-<name> | status: <status> | parent: J-NNNN[,J-NNNN] | supersedes: J-NNNN

* `stream` - the work stream the entry belongs to (see S-entries below). One entry, one stream.
* `status` - `open` (stream created), `wip`, `done` (milestone reached), `blocked` (says on what), `dropped`.
* `parent` - the entry this work builds on; parallel work forks from the same parent.
* `supersedes` - optional, the entry this one corrects.

Body: short bullet fields, all optional except `next`:

* **did** - what was done. **found** - facts learned (with numbers). **decided** - decisions (also go to
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). **metrics** - `key=value` pairs, the same keys reused across entries so they can be
  plotted. **next** - the immediate next step of this stream. **fork** - `S<n>-<name>: <scope>; needs <entries>` -
  a stream that can start in parallel from here.

A new stream is opened by an entry with `status: open` in that stream, stating its scope and entry point.

### J-0001 | 2026-11-03 | stream: S0-arch | status: done | parent: -

* **did** - Surveyed the decomp (momusdigital/fnv_decomp @ `87eb9373a0bb7c9a38070be4f00c3bcb615d928d`) and the
  existing Switch effort (CypherNoodle/FNV-nx: PC port branch, no engine boot yet).
* **found** - 2,978 units, 3,255 `.cpp`, 4.8 M lines; built with MSVC 2008 SP1/RTM x86-32; 286 `__asm` sites in 83
  files (148 in `include/fnv_asm_helpers.h`); `<windows.h>` in 180 files, `<d3d9.h>` in 6 (+ D3D9 through Gamebryo
  `NiDX9*`); `<xmmintrin.h>` in 523; 3,171 `static_assert(sizeof ...)`; real `virtual` classes (751 k `virtual`
  tokens), not hand-made vtables; 68 virtual-inheritance sites; 31 bitfields; 2 `long double`.
* **found** - the README states the tree builds object files for comparison, not a game. Licence: none granted.
* **next** - measure linking (how units reference each other) before choosing the data model.

### J-0002 | 2026-11-03 | stream: S0-arch | status: done | parent: J-0001

* **did** - Classified all 219,404 symbol references in `build/units.json` against the 68,657 defined functions.
* **found** - Units reference each other **by address**: 97,575 referenced addresses, 35,747 of them are defined
  functions, reached through many differently decorated names (up to 1,957 names for one address, `*_shell`
  classes, local re-declarations). 10,805 referenced `.text` addresses have no definition (CRT, thunks, helpers).
  51,019 referenced addresses are data in `0x00fdf000..0x0200c612` with no definition in source. 288 imports.
* **found** - Toolchain probe: clang 18 cannot do AArch64 ILP32 for ELF and refuses `-fc++-abi=microsoft` there;
  GCC 13 `aarch64-linux-gnu -mabi=ilp32` works (`sizeof(void*) == 4`). devkitPro hosts and Docker Hub are not
  reachable from the dev container (403 / 429), so Ubuntu's `g++-aarch64-linux-gnu` 13.2 is the stand-in compiler.
* **decided** - D1: AArch64 + ILP32 + 32-bit address space. D3: data image from the player's exe at original
  addresses. D4: link by address with generated ABI bridges. (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
* **metrics** - units=2978 defined_functions=68657 undefined_text_addrs=10805 undefined_data_addrs=51019 imports=288
* **next** - S1 compile census.
* **fork** - S2-link: address-resolving link step over ELF objects (MSVC-decorated names in units.json -> Itanium
  names in objects -> address -> definition), bridge generation; needs J-0002 and objects from S1 (any clean unit
  is enough to start).
* **fork** - S3-dataimage: loader that maps `.rdata/.data/.bss` of the player's `FalloutNV.exe` at original
  addresses in the 32-bit address space and patches code pointers; needs J-0002 and the S2 address map format.
* **fork** - S4-runtime: the 10,805 undefined `.text` addresses (classify CRT vs thunk vs mid-function) and the
  288 imports; Win32 subset over libnx; needs J-0002.
* **fork** - S5-toolchain: ILP32 ELF -> NSO, NPDM with 32-bit address space, libnx boundary (LP64 shims or libnx
  built ILP32), devkitA64 in place of the stand-in compiler; independent.
* **fork** - S6-render: D3D9 / `NiDX9Renderer` -> deko3d or Vulkan(NVK), shader translation; needs S1 headers.
* **fork** - S7-audio-input: DirectSound/XAudio, DirectInput/XInput -> libnx audren/hid; needs S4 API list.
* **fork** - S8-asm: the 286 `__asm` sites (`fnv_asm_helpers.h` first) -> portable C++/NEON; independent.

### J-0003 | 2026-11-03 | stream: S1-compile | status: wip | parent: J-0002

* **did** - `tools/census.sh`: `-fsyntax-only` of every unit with `aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ -mabi=ilp32 -std=gnu++17
  -fms-extensions -fshort-wchar -fpermissive`, force-included `shim/include/fnvnx_compat.h` (MSVC keywords,
  `__declspec(x)` -> `__fnvnx_ds_x`), empty shim `windows.h`/`d3d9.h`/`intrin.h`, `xmmintrin.h` -> sse2neon.
* **found** - run1 (no rewrites): 1,925 / 2,978 units clean, 39,511 errors; 8,489 of the "missing name" errors
  are `__m128`: ~400 files carry local copies of MSVC's `union __m128` and `_mm_*` prototypes that clash with a
  real SSE implementation.
* **decided** - D2: build from a tree derived by `tools/prepare.py` (rules, never hand edits of the decomp). D5:
  SSE through sse2neon. Rules SSE1 (drop local vector unions, 398 files / 546 edits), SSE2 (drop local `_mm_*`
  prototypes and emptied `extern "C"` blocks, 375 / 6,041), SSE3 (`v.m128_f32[i]` -> typed element access,
  153 / 836).
* **found** - run2 (with SSE1-3): 2,002 clean, 8,952 errors. Top misses: Win32 types (`DWORD` 757, `LONG`,
  `CRITICAL_SECTION`, `TlsGetValue`, `Interlocked*`), x87/`rdtsc` inline asm (`fld` 172, `rdtsc` 136), Havok SIMD
  types (`hkQuadReal`, `P064Quad`) still defined in terms of the removed local `__m128`, 497 "conflicting
  declaration with C linkage".
* **metrics** - census_units=2978 census_clean=2002 census_errors=8952
* **next** - fill `fnvnx_win32.h` from the miss list; rule for `__asm` blocks (S8 owns the semantics, S1 only needs
  them to parse); look at the C-linkage conflicts.

### J-0004 | 2026-11-03 | stream: S0-arch | status: done | parent: J-0003

* **did** - Added rules SSE4 (qualified `N::__m128` -> global), DECL1 (drop the decomp's prototypes of CRT/Win32
  functions and namespace-scope `operator new/delete` outside classes; the platform headers declare them with target
  types - `size_t` is `unsigned long` on AArch64 ILP32, `unsigned int` on MSVC x86), NEW1 (`unsigned int` size
  parameters of `operator new/delete` -> `size_t`); filled `fnvnx_win32.h` with the 32-bit SDK types and the Win32
  subset (run3: 2,059 clean / 7,475 errors before SSE4/DECL1/NEW1; not yet measured with them).
* **decided** - Per-stream ownership to work in parallel without conflicts: prepare rules owned by a stream live in
  `tools/rules/<stream>.py` (loaded after the core rules); each stream owns its directories. Streams do not edit this
  journal; they hand in a draft entry and it is appended here in order.
* **did** - Opened S1-compile (continues), S2-link, S3-dataimage, S4-runtime, S5-toolchain, S6-render, S8-asm in
  parallel. Ownership: S1 `tools/prepare.py`, `tools/rules/s1_compile.py`, `shim/include` except D3D9; S2
  `tools/link/`, `docs/LINK.md`; S3 `loader/`, `docs/DATAIMAGE.md`; S4 `platform/`, `docs/RUNTIME.md`; S5
  `toolchain/`, `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`; S6 `shim/include/d3d9*.h`, `d3dx9*.h`, `render/`, `docs/RENDER.md`; S8
  `tools/rules/s8_asm.py`, `shim/include/fnvnx_asm.h`, `docs/ASM.md`; tests under `tests/s<n>/`.
* **next** - merge stream results as they land; S7-audio-input opens once S4 has the API list.
